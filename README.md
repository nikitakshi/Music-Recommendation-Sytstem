Music Recommendation System
This repository contains the code for a Music Recommendation System using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques. The system aims to provide personalized music recommendations to users based on their listening history and preferences.

Features
Collaborative filtering based on user-item ratings to identify similar users and recommend music based on their preferences.
Matrix factorization using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to learn latent factors and make personalized recommendations.
Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision to assess the performance of the recommendation system.
Interactive user interface to input user preferences and receive personalized music recommendations.
Dataset preprocessing and cleaning methods to handle missing values and outliers.
Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-recommendation-system.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Preprocess the dataset: Run the preprocess_data.py script to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
Train the models: Run the train_models.py script to train the collaborative filtering and matrix factorization models.
Evaluate the models: Run the evaluate_models.py script to calculate evaluation metrics for the trained models.
Generate recommendations: Use the interactive user interface in the recommendation_app.py script to input user preferences and receive personalized music recommendations.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Music Listening Dataset" containing user-item ratings and music metadata. The dataset is available for download at https://www.kaggle.com%2Fc%2Fkkbox-music-recommendation-challenge%2Fdata&design=DAEjrwWV35w&accessRole=viewer&linkSource=document
